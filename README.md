# Weather-app
This is javascript weather web app made with just html, css and javascript. I used fetch to get the data from a weather api and make this project.

#Cross-origin error!!
If you encounter this error in your app, thats probably because the local host is not allowed to access the data from the api.

So the simplest fix for this error is:

-- https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ --

Add this url with your api url and your project will work fine.
